## Abstract
Since November 2021, five genetically distinct Omicron lineages (named BA.1 through BA.5) have emerged in southern Africa, with four of the lineages (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5) spreading throughout the world and collectively dominating global SARS-CoV-2 populations. During 2023, BA.2.86, another highly divergent BA.2 lineage was detected and rose to prominence globally. Although BA.2.86 was first discovered in Israel and Denmark in July 2023, the high diversity of sampled South African BA.2.86 sequences in July and August of 2023 indicate that, as with the progenitors of all the BA lineages, it too likely emerged in southern Africa. Here we integrate spatial mapping and advanced Bayesian phylogeographic techniques to infer the geographical origins and dispersion patterns of BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4, BA.5 and BA.2.86 within the region. This approach was critical in determining the presence, or lack thereof, of shared dispersal patterns and/or a common geographical origin for these highly divergent and globally significant lineages. We find that South Africaâ€™s Gauteng province is the predicted origin of BA.1, BA.3, BA.4, BA.5, and BA.2.86 and is the local and regional dispersal hub for all six of the lineages. It remains unclear whether Gauteng province, situated in the north-eastern part of the country, is the true origin of these lineages or whether, given its high population density and prominence as a transport hub, it is an amplification zone of highly transmissible new variants. It remains highly plausible therefore that one or more less well sampled regions of southern Africa are the actual source(s) of the lineages. Although the degree of SARS-CoV-2 sampling across southern Africa in the months bounding the emergence of the analysed lineages is insufficient to pinpoint the precise geographical origins of the lineages at sub-provincial resolution, our results support the hypothesis that an epidemiologically unique reservoir of rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants exists in southern Africa, likely demarcated by an area encompassing the north-eastern part of South Africa. The implication of these results underscores the urgent need for broader genomic surveillance across the region, which could yield critical data for preempting the emergence of highly divergent, and potentially globally consequential, SARS-CoV-2 variants.
